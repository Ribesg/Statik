Issues Guidelines
------------------
* Tasks should be defined for individual features

Issue lifecycle and Huboard
---------------------------
* Tasks are created in the *Backlog* stage
* If a task is **blocked**, comment with the **task number(s)** blocking it
  * Create this(those) ticket(s) if needed
* If a task is **completely defined** and isn't blocked, it can be moved to the *Ready* stage
* If you decide to work on a *Ready* stage task, assign yourself to it and move it to the *Working* stage
  * Please don't work on too many tasks at once, it's better to have only one task assigned
* When you are working on a task (*Working* stage) and you think the task is done, **mark it as ready
to move to the next stage** so that somebody else can review your work and actually move it to the *Done* stage
* When moving a task to the *Done* stage, please **search for tasks blocked** because of this newly done task and **unblock them** if possible
